# PICASso Platform

Monorepo for the PICASso QA & documentation platform, combining automated documentation generation with AI-assisted Playwright test automation for the Schneider Electric PICASso web application.

## Packages

| Package | Language | Purpose |
| ------- | -------- | ------- |
| [`projects/docs-generator`](projects/docs-generator/) | Python 3.11+ | CLI for generating release notes, meeting notes, test cases, bug reports from Jira/Confluence/Figma |
| [`projects/pw-autotest`](projects/pw-autotest/) | TypeScript | AI-assisted Playwright test automation with Allure 3 reporting |

## Prerequisites

| Tool | Minimum Version |
| ---- | --------------- |
| Python | 3.11+ |
| Node.js | 18+ |
| npm | 9+ |
| Claude Code | latest |

## Quick Start

### Docs Generator (Python)

```bash
cd projects/docs-generator
pip install -r requirements.txt
cp ../../.env.example ../../.env   # Edit .env with your Jira, Confluence, Figma API keys
python3 main.py --help
```

> **API Keys required:** `JIRA_*`, `CONFLUENCE_*`, and optionally `FIGMA_API_TOKEN`. See [`.env.example`](.env.example) for all variables and descriptions.

### PW AutoTest (TypeScript)

```bash
cd projects/pw-autotest
npm ci
npx playwright install --with-deps
npm test           # Runs all tests + generates Allure report
```

#### Additional test commands

| Command | Description |
| ------- | ----------- |
| `npm run test:chromium` | Chromium only |
| `npm run test:firefox` | Firefox only |
| `npm run test:webkit` | WebKit only |
| `npm run test:mobile` | Mobile Chrome + Safari |
| `npm run test:smoke` | Smoke suite |
| `npm run test:headed` | Headed mode |
| `npm run test:debug` | Debug mode |
| `npm run test:ui` | Playwright UI mode |
| `npm run report:allure` | Re-generate & open Allure report |
| `npm run lint` | Lint TypeScript sources |
| `npm run typecheck` | Type-check without emitting |
| `npm run clean` | Remove all test artefacts |

## AI Tooling

The platform includes two AI-oriented instruction surfaces:

- Claude assets in `.claude/` for Claude Code workflows
- GitHub Copilot assets in `.github/` for prompt-driven workflows in VS Code

Both approaches are MCP-first. Jira and Confluence data should come from MCP tools when available; Python is reserved for rendering and document generation.

### MCP Servers

Configured in [`.claude/settings.json`](.claude/settings.json):

| Server | Tools | Purpose |
| ------ | ----- | ------- |
| `mcp-atlassian` | `jira_*`, `confluence_*` | Fetch issues, versions, stories, pages |
| `figma` | `figma_*` | Access designs, variables, screenshots |
| `playwright` | `browser_*` | Live browser automation for test generation |
| `sequential-thinking` | — | Extended reasoning for complex tasks |

### Claude Code Skills

Invoke these in Claude Code with `/skill-name`:

| Skill | Purpose |
| ----- | ------- |
| `/create-user-stories` | Generate JIRA-ready user stories from a Confluence spec page |
| `/create-test-cases` | Generate manual test cases from a Jira story |
| `/create-test-cases-for-automation` | Generate structured test cases for Playwright automation |
| `/create-automation-scripts` | Generate Playwright TypeScript tests via live browser exploration |
| `/create-release-notes-short` | Generate Yammer-format release notes from a Jira version |
| `/create-release-note-detailed` | Generate full HTML + PPTX release notes |
| `/create-meeting-notes` | Generate meeting notes from a transcript file |
| `/push-stories-to-jira` | Push generated user stories to Jira as Story issues |
| `/push` | Stage, commit, and push all changes |

### GitHub Copilot workflow

GitHub Copilot instructions and prompts live in `.github/`:

- `.github/copilot-instructions.md` — entry router
- `.github/instructions/` — split instruction files for intake, normalization, test cases, browser validation, and Playwright generation
- `.github/prompts/` — task prompts for full-pipeline or stage-by-stage execution

Recommended QA automation flow with Copilot:

1. Normalize Jira, Confluence, or free-text requirements into `output/requirements/`
2. Generate automation-ready test cases in `output/test_cases/`
3. Validate locators and flows with Playwright MCP
4. Generate or update tests in `projects/pw-autotest/`
5. Save generation metadata in `output/automation_scripts/`

See `docs/ai/pipeline.md` for the full split workflow.

### AI Agents

Specialized subagents in [`.claude/agents/`](.claude/agents/):

| Agent | Purpose |
| ----- | ------- |
| `automation-tester` | Generates Playwright test scripts from scenarios |
| `business-analyst` | Creates user stories and acceptance criteria |
| `manual-tester` | Creates manual test cases from specs |
| `atlas` | Fetches and summarizes data from Jira and Confluence |

```

## Shared I/O

The `input/` and `output/` directories at the repo root are used for generated artifacts across both tracks. Notable QA automation folders include `output/requirements/`, `output/test_cases/`, and `output/automation_scripts/`. Path configuration for rendered document generation is in `projects/docs-generator/config.yaml`.

## CI/CD

| Workflow | Trigger | Purpose |
| -------- | ------- | ------- |
| `playwright.yml` | Changes in `projects/pw-autotest/` | Run Playwright tests |
| `docs.yml` | Changes in `projects/docs-generator/` | Validate Python CLI |
| `claude.yml` | `@claude` mentions in issues/PRs | Claude GitHub Action |
| `claude-code-review.yml` | PR opened/updated | Automated code review |

## Contributing

1. Fork the repository and create a feature branch
2. Follow the coding conventions enforced by ESLint / Prettier (pw-autotest) or PEP 8 (docs-generator)
3. Ensure all tests pass before opening a PR — PRs trigger automated Playwright runs and Claude code review
4. Reference relevant Jira tickets in your PR description
