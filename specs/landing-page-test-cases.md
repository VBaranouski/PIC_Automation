## Coverage Analysis

### Current State (Tracker DB)

| Metric | Count |
|--------|-------|
| Total scenarios | ~70 |
| Automated + passed | ~42 |
| Automated + skipped | ~8 |
| Automated + failed-defect | 3 |
| Pending (not-executed) | 23 |

### Coverage Gaps Identified (§4.1 Five Dimensions)

| Dimension | Status | Gap |
|-----------|--------|-----|
| **Happy Path** | ✅ Covered | All 5 tabs, grid load, default tab |
| **Negative / Validation** | ❌ Missing | Empty state (WF02-0005), no-match search, invalid date range |
| **Role-Based Access** | ❌ Missing | No role restriction tests for header actions (New Product visibility per role) |
| **State Transitions** | ⚠️ Partial | Show Active Only toggle tested; but no tab-switch-while-loading test |
| **Data Integrity** | ⚠️ Partial | Read-back after filter; but no cross-tab data consistency |

### Duplicate / Overlapping Scenarios to Consolidate

| Existing (automated) | Pending (duplicate) | Action |
|---|---|---|
| `LANDING-TASKS-REL-001` (Release filter) | `WF02-0015` (Release filter narrows task list) | Mark WF02-0015 as duplicate → on-hold |
| `LANDING-TASKS-PROD-001` (Product filter) | `WF02-0016` (Product filter narrows task list) | Mark WF02-0016 as duplicate → on-hold |
| `LANDING-TASKS-DATE-001` (Date range visible) | `WF02-0017` (Date range filters results) | Different: 001 is visibility, 0017 is functional → keep both |
| `LANDING-TASKS-ASSIGNEE-001` (Assignee visible) | `WF02-0018` (Assignee changes list) | Different: 001 is visibility, 0018 is functional → keep both |
| `LANDING-TASKS-TYPE-001` (PROCESS TYPE values) | `WF02-0008` (PROCESS TYPE correct values) | Duplicate → mark WF02-0008 as on-hold |
| `LANDING-PRODS-ORG2-001` (Org Level 2 filter) | `WF02-0031` (Org Level 2 cascades) | Duplicate → mark WF02-0031 as on-hold |
| `LANDING-PRODS-DOCLEAD-001` (DOC Lead filter) | `WF02-0032` (DOC Lead narrows) | Duplicate → mark WF02-0032 as on-hold |
| `LANDING-PRODS-OWNER-001` (Product Owner filter) | `WF02-0033` (Product Owner narrows) | Duplicate → mark WF02-0033 as on-hold |
| `LANDING-RELS-JIRA-001` (Jira link clickable) | `WF02-0047` (Jira link clickable) | Duplicate → mark WF02-0047 as on-hold |
| `LANDING-RELS-ACTIONS-002` (Clone option) | `WF02-0048` (Actions menu Clone) | Overlapping → mark WF02-0048 as on-hold |
| `LANDING-HEADER-005` (logo nav existing) | `LANDING-HEADER-005` (pending, same ID) | Already has test code; fix tracker status |

### Net New Scenarios to Create

After deduplication, **10 genuinely new scenarios** remain:

## Review Gate Checklist (§5)

| # | Check | Pass? |
|---|-------|-------|
| 1 | Every step uses an allowed verb (Navigate, Click, Type, Select, Verify, Confirm) | ✅ |
| 2 | Every expected result is machine-verifiable (visibility, state, text, URL, count) | ✅ |
| 3 | No vague terms ("looks correct", "works", "displays properly") | ✅ |
| 4 | UI element names match DOM snapshot from exploration-findings.md | ✅ |
| 5 | Negative cases: no-match search (`LANDING-TASKS-EMPTY-001`), empty state (`WF02-0005`) | ✅ |
| 6 | Role-based: not applicable for landing (all tabs visible to `process_quality_leader`; role-restricted tests belong in `auth` area) | ✅ N/A |
| 7 | State transitions: sort toggle, rapid tab switch, Show Active Only toggle | ✅ |
| 8 | Data integrity: filter → record count → reset → count restored (all filter tests) | ✅ |
| 9 | Cross-feature: product name click → Product Detail; release name click → Release Detail | ✅ |
| 10 | No environment-specific hardcoded values (counts, dates, user names) | ✅ |
